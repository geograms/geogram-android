AutoName: Geogram
Summary: Offline-first mesh communication app

Description: |-
  Geogram is an offline-first communication ecosystem for resilient, decentralized
  messaging. It uses NOSTR protocol for end-to-end encrypted messaging, BLE beacons
  for proximity-based discovery, and integrates with radio communications (APRS/FM).

  Features:
  * NOSTR-based encrypted messaging with offline caching
  * BLE beacon proximity detection and device discovery
  * Native Android APIs (no Google dependencies)
  * Automatic identity generation (npub/nsec/callsign)
  * APRS integration for radio communications
  * Location tracking for emergency response

  All communication is end-to-end encrypted using NOSTR protocol. Messages are
  cached locally and sync when connectivity is available. No central server required.
